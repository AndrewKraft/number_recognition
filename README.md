# number_recognition

I'm practicing using a simple feedforward neural network to classify images of handwritten numbers.

The datasets used were taken from [The MNIST Database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Thanks to Yann LeCun, Corianna Cortes and Christopher J.C. Burges for compiling this dataset.

The textbook [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) immensely helped my understanding of the backpropagation algorithm and neural networks in general. Ironically enough, it uses the same dataset and idea for its example neural network (although I didn't know that when I set out to build this).
